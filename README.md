# California-Housing

California-Housing is a simple Linear Regression Model that will make predictions using Scikit-learn's California housing dataset. The goal of this mini project is to get familiar with the process of performing Machine Learning (in this case Linear Regression) on a data set. I aim to use what I learned from this project on a more complex Machine Learning Model.
